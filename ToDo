-----------------------------------------
* PWM_Controller
* Add timeout to PWM_Controller, so each channel will timeout and 
    turn off if it doesn't receive an update within a set period of time.
* Add Version information to libPWM.a, force library to disconnect if 
    the versions don't match.
* Finish writing the script to make a symbolic link of a specific 
    USB FTDI chip.
* Change access to PWM_controller shared memory so you don't need root access to connect.
* Add README data to each sub project.
  - Daemon README/INSTALL
  - Firmware README/INSTALL
* Create better install script.
